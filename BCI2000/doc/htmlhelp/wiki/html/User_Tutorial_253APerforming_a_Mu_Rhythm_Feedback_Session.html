<a name="Preparation"></a><h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>If you quit BCI2000 after the <a href="User_Tutorial%253AConfiguring_Online_Feedback.html" title="User Tutorial:Configuring Online Feedback">previous step,</a> start it using the appropriate batch file at <tt>batch/CursorTask_&lt;YourAmplifier&gt;.bat</tt>, or the link to that file which you created on the desktop.
</p><p>Then, load the configuration file that you saved in the previous step.
</p><p>Click <i>Set Config</i> to view the EEG signal, and <a href="User_Tutorial%253AEEG_Measurement_Setup.html" title="User Tutorial:EEG Measurement Setup">prepare the subject for EEG recording</a> as you did for the <a href="User_Tutorial%253AObtaining_Mu_Rhythm_Parameters_in_an_Initial_Session.html" title="User Tutorial:Obtaining Mu Rhythm Parameters in an Initial Session">initial session</a>.
</p>
<a name="Instructions_to_the_Subject"></a><h2>Instructions to the Subject</h2>
<p>When the subject is ready for EEG acquisition, it is time to brief the subject about the experimental task. Suggested instructions to the experimenter and subject are listed below.
</p><p>A screen with a yellow grid is initially presented. As soon as the subject is
ready and the EEG traces are stabilized, the investigator will start the
acquisition. For each trial, four phases will occur:
</p>
<ol><li>Target presentation. A target appears on the right edge of the screen for about one second.
</li><li>Cursor movement. A cursor appears on the left edge of the screen, and begins to move horizontally towards the right edge of the screen. Its vertical position is controlled by the EEG features that were defined in the previous step. The subject's task is to move the cursor vertically so that it hits the target when the cursor hits the right edge of the screen. The time needed for the cursor to move from the left to the right edge of the screen should last approximately three seconds.
</li><li>Result. If the subject successfully hits the target, the target changes its color. Otherwise, no change occurs. In either case, this period lasts one second.
</li><li>Intertrial Interval. The screen will then turn black for one second.  This indicates the end of the trial. After this one-second period, the next trial starts.
</li></ol>
<p>When a target is presented, the subject should imagine the type of movement associated with the channel-frequency features <a href="User_Tutorial%253AAnalyzing_the_Initial_Mu_Rhythm_Session.html" title="User Tutorial:Analyzing the Initial Mu Rhythm Session">chosen for feedback</a>. For example, when the largest r-squared value was associated with left hand movement imagination in the offline analysis, ask the subject to use this imagination to control the direction of cursor movement. Imagined movement will move the cursor upward on the screen, and relaxing will move it downward.
</p><p>Explicitly specifying a type of imagination to control cursor movement will help the subject achieve initial cursor control. Once the subject has become more proficient with the task, motor imagery typically becomes less important. In this situation, it is not uncommon that subjects report that they just "imagine to move the cursor."
</p><p>The second set of instructions to the subject regards the minimization of
<a href="User_Tutorial%253AEEG_Measurement_Setup.html#EEG_Artifacts" title="User Tutorial:EEG Measurement Setup">artifacts</a> from
</p>
<ul><li>Contraction of the muscles of the face/head, swallowing;
</li><li>Eye blinks and eye movements;
</li><li>Motion.
</li></ul>
<p>Provided that subjects are asked to minimize artifacts, he/she should be further
assisted in these efforts by providing a comfortable chair and a dimly lit room.
The
experimenter must carefully monitor the EEG and alert the subject in the case
he/she has forgotten some of the instructions.
When the experimenter is sure that his/her instructions have been well
understood, the recording session may start.
</p><p>Click the <i>Start</i> button to start the feedback experiment.
During the experiment, the subject's performance is written into a log window on the experimenter's screen, and recorded into a log file that is saved to disk in the session directory. The experimenter should minimize noise in the room and not disturb the subject.
</p>
<a name="Monitoring_the_Recording"></a><h2>Monitoring the Recording</h2>
<p>After recording has started, the experimenter may feel the temptation to leave
the subject alone during the run since most of the experimental activities are
automated in BCI2000. However, the experimenter has several important 
tasks during the experiment:
</p>
<ul><li>Filling in a run-sheet to report information that is not automatically recorded by BCI2000 and that will later help when data are analyzed (e.g., subject did not seem to understand the instructions in the first run, instructions to the subject for a particular run, etc.).
</li><li>Monitoring the EEG signal to verify the quality of the recording (e.g., no electrode contact failure, muscular, ocular, or motion artifacts, etc.)
</li><li>Reinforce the subject: notify the subject if he/she is producing artifacts, keep the subject alert if getting drowsy, give the subject feedback about his/her performance so that interest, alertness, and attention is kept high.
</li></ul>
<p>The run sheet is the most important means of communication between the
technician who performs the recordings and the person who analyzes the data
(or a comprehensive reminder if somebody does both). It is important that
it is compiled carefully and that it is rich in what may seem to be obvious detail: only
time will say what is standard and what changes from session to session, and if
you will need to analyze data acquired years before, you are likely to miss information
if you did not record all information.
</p>
<a name="Multiple_Sessions"></a><h2>Multiple Sessions</h2>
<p>Once a run has ended, BCI2000 goes into suspended state.
Further runs will be added to the session when you click <i>Resume</i>.
After the session has finished, you may want to save auto-adjusted parameters for the next session.
Use <i>Save Parameters</i> from the configuration window to do this.
</p><p>Alternatively, the <i>Load Parameters</i> dialog allows you to choose a data file rather than a parameter file, and thus use the configuration contained in a previous session's data file for the next session. However, parameters contained in a data file reflect the state at the <i>beginning</i> of the recording, so changes during a session's last run cannot be recovered that way.
</p><p>When starting the next session, don't forget to increment the <i>SessionNumber</i> parameter on the <i>Storage</i> tab. Otherwise, new runs will be added to the previous session's directory. As a safety net, BCI2000 will never overwrite existing data files, and it documents date and time in the <i>StorageTime</i> parameter. This allows to later separate data files into runs even if the <i>SessionNumber</i> parameter has not been increased.
</p><p>After each session, it is recommended that you analyze the recorded data in the same way as you did for the  <a href="User_Tutorial%253AObtaining_Mu_Rhythm_Parameters_in_an_Initial_Session.html" title="User Tutorial:Obtaining Mu Rhythm Parameters in an Initial Session">initial session</a>. This allows you to track and adapt to signal changes in the subject's parameters that may occur in the course of learning.
</p>
<a name="Important_Remarks"></a><h2>Important Remarks</h2>
<p>One critical element of such experiments is that they need to be consistent and rigorous. For example, a typical session will consist of a number (e.g., 4-8) of 3-min experimental runs. Unless there is an obvious technical problem (e.g., the cursor always immediately jumps to the bottom of the screen, which would point to a misconfiguration of BCI2000), do not change any of the parameters (such as locations, frequencies, etc.) across these runs. When doing offline analyses, always strive to collect at least four runs with the exact same configuration. Because there is so much variability in the subject's performance and in the EEG, it is likely that you will otherwise not be able to derive meaningful results or conclusions. You may find that, for example, for three consecutive sessions the subject's best frequency is 12 Hz and not 10 Hz as initially configured. In this case, you could make this small adaptation to the parameters, and have a reasonable chance that it will actually improve the subject's performance.
